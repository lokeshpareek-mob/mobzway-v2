                Once you have decided on the topic and written your article or
                blog, check and make your write-up as error-free as possible.
                You can submit guest posts or sponsor a post for us. Afterwards,
                you are expected to reach out to us at editor@mobzway.com, and
                we shall get back to us soon after you submit your manuscript.
                We shall discuss the next steps after that. Remember that once
                you submit your manuscript and publish it, the copyright for the
                guest post shall stay with our company. Therefore, you shall not
                be able to publish that article anywhere else.
